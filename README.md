# mini-inventory

1. This mini inventory is my project in my 3rd yr of school. And the duration of time that i did this is about 1 and half months tho its not highly functional inventory but it can do CRUD and have bootstrap in it, some js and relational database. I know that this inventory can be upgraded and more functional but i decided to upgrade it next time because of my schedule and many works to do in school.

2. I base this inventory to the company that my team interviewed and decided to create.

3. Im happy to people will copy and use this inventory as a part of getting idea or knowledge to them. 

HAPPY CODING !!!!!!!!!!!
